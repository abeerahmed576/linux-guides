# Linux Guides on Software Installation, HowTo's

Short guides on HowTo's, Error fixing and various useful software installation.
These are guides inspired by the many situations I faced throughout my Linux journey.

**Warning**: All the guides here are for Arch Linux and it's derivatives. Many commands (e.g. Package Manager commands) should be adjusted for other Linux distros like: Debian, Fedora etc.
